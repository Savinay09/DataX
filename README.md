## Problem
Failure to segment, lack of personalization, and emails not adding value are the top reasons why promotional emails often get ignored. Emotional marketing involves arousing emotions that cause the consumers to act. Based on the Russell modeling diagram and the mood maintenance hypothesis, we focus on 6 targeted marketing emotions - enthusiasm, trust, inclusivity, surprise, greed and urgency. Although companies fail to keep these measures in mind when writing emails to attract their users, E-motion solves this problem by helping marketing organizations - like Oracle - use emotion to effectively automate marketing strategy and prioritize their email marketing efforts. 

The teamâ€™s primary goal was to accurately and efficiently determine the varying levels of intensity for particular marketing emotions portrayed by promotional subject lines. Emails are still a main medium for advertising, especially in areas of company recruitment and grocery shopping. As such, understanding the emotions evoked by email subject lines is extremely important in predicting email open rate. This is because certain emotions like trust or greed make people more likely to act on impulse than reason which can lead to a higher chance of them opening the specific promotional email. In this effort, E-motion would be a comprehensive tool to allow marketers to fully understand the emotions being provoked to fully exploit email subject lines to increase email open rates. 

## Detailed Solution 
With the  graphics and data displayed by E-motion, marketers are better able to understand how varying diction can lead to different intensity levels of the target marketing emotions. With such analysis, marketers can customize email subject lines to fit along certain campaigns whether they are focused on evoking a sense of enthusiasm or urgency. This neat UI allows users to compare multiple subject lines based on emotional intensities and aids them in strategic marketing decisions. Users are able to compare and contrast up to five subject lines in any combinations they choose. The complex backend infrastructure culminates in a functional user experience.
